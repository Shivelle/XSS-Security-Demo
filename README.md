# XSS Security Demo

This little demo project showcases some common XSS vulnerabilities in a simple rails project.

To get started, set up the database and run `rails db:seed` to get the showcased examples.

### Further Development
If you want to modify or add to the seeds, you can reseed the database by running `Post.destroy_all` in the console to clear the old posts and just running `rails db:seed` again.
